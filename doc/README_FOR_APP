Welcome to the README for BestBay!

Welcome to Bob The Builders's BestBay Rdoc!

This is the API documentation for Rails Application Documentation.
This rdoc focuses on four good design quality attributes: accuracy, brevity, clarity and organization.

Bob The Builders implemented four core models. These are:

    I. User - all the user account details.
    II. Category - all the categories that we have implemented for BestBay
    III. Items - all the information about an item that will be placed for buy/sell.
    IV. Item Image â€“ the images used for the items that will be placed for buy/sell.

Please click on the rdoc column to view the classes and modules implemented by our team.
